# Hello there :wave:

I'm an Undergraduate at ENSIIE 🏫 following courses within the domains of Computer Science 💻 and Mathematics 📐.

From 15/08/2021 and for a year, I will be studying computer science in UQAC 🇨🇦 !   

Luckily, I have no time to be impatient since I landed an internship in the field of AR for my second year internship.
