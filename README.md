# Hello there :wave:

I'm an Undergraduate at ENSIIE following courses within the domains of Computer Science and Mathematics.

From 15/08/2021 and for a year, I will be studying computer science in UQAC ðŸ‡¨ðŸ‡¦ !  

As a part of my first year internship in June and July 2020 I wrote a script to import proofs from Logipedia to Agda in Deducteam.  

Luckily, I landed an internship in the field of AR for my second year in a startup.
