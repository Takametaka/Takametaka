# Hello there :wave:

I'm an Undergraduate at ENSIIE following courses within the domains of Computer Science and Mathematics.

Iâ€™m currently working on a script to import proofs from Logipedia to Agda in Deducteam. This is part of my first year internship in June and July.

I'm planning on writing a graphics library in C based on wayland. I already started to write it on X11 (Sven11) but I want to switch to Wayland (SvenLand ?).
